# Face-recognition-attendance

To run this program you need :
1- python 3.6
2- pip install dlib library
3- pip install face_recognition library
4- pip install openpyxl
5- pip install opencv

if the GUI is not displaying correctly then install python 3.8 too, but still run the program with python 3.6
and that should fix it.
